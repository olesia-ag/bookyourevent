# BookYourEvent

### - features keep being added
### While I've been working as meetings and catering manager the most part of my work was to answer the phone and check meeting space availability so I kept dreaming about the time when there will be an app which will make it possible for clients to online and check it themselves. Well... here it is.   'Book your event'  is a web-app that allows non-registered users to check availability of the space and submit a request form to book the event (only one per one email address). These requests will appear in user's (it can be a manager) dashboard where they can be confirmed/declined/edited.


# Tech Stack
* PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM and Express.js was used for back end
* React, React Redux was used for fron end
* Webpack is used for an app bundler
